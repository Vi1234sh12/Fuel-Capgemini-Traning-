/*
Create an abstract class Instrument which is having the abstract function play. Create three more sub 
classes from Instrument which is Piano, Flute, Guitar. Override the play method inside all three classes 
printing a message “Piano is playing tan tan tan tan ” for Piano class “Flute is playing toot toot toot toot” 
for Flute class “Guitar is playing tin tin tin ” for Guitar class You must not allow the user to declare an 
object of Instrument class. Create an array of 10 Instruments. Assign different type of instrument to 
Instrument reference. Check for the polymorphic behavior of play method. Use the instanceof operator 
to print that which object stored at which index of instrument array.
